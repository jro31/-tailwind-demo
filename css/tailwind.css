// This creates a '.btn' class that has all the included styling, so it can be reused anywhere

// Using '@layer' here ensures that the '.btn' class is generated in the correct place (before 'utilities')
// (you could alternatively just add the '.btn' class before '@tailwind utilities', but this way is cleaner and saves you remembering)
// If it was generated after, you wouldn't be able to over-write the '.btn' class styling
// For example <a class='btn px-10'> would have styling of 'px-5' (from the '.btn' styling), because the 'px-10' is generated with the '@tailwind utilities' declaration, then you would generate the '.btn' class afterwards
// Instead, we need to generate '.btn' first (straight after 'components'), then run '@tailwind utilities' afterwards. That is what '@layer components' does here.
